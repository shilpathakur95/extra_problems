1.Given two strings which are unsigned integer numbers (in string format) write an adder to add the numbers. Lenghts of both can be different.
2.An unsigned number Q is formed by taking input P which is an unsigned integer in string format, K: number of times P repeated to form Q. write a function to find whether the number Q is divisible by 11 or not .Ex: Q : 123123123 P : 123 K : 3
3.Given a unsigned number as a string input (it can be of length, max 10000 chars) write a function to find whether the number is divisible by 11 or not.
